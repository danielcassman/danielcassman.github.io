2017 is the year of the bezel-less smartphone. Ever since the [LG Prada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Prada) was released in May 2007, capacitive touchscreens have become the dominant smartphone interface. Apple popularized them with the [original iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation) (November 2007), and now they're ubiquitous. But the touchscreen has typically been borderd by unsightly bezels. That started to change this year.

Well, it really started last year. Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi launched the [Mi Mix](http://www.mi.com/en/mix/) in November 2016. It was hard to get in the United States, but pretty much everyone thought it was beautiful, and a stunning innovation in the stale slab-like smartphone design that's been essentially unchanged since 2007.

### The Bottom Chin

The Mi Mix might have been a breath of fresh air, but the front camera placement was awkward. While the top of the screen curves beautifully into the top corners of the device, the phone has a noticeable chin at the bottom where the front camera is placed. And that's the fundamental problem with the bezel-less design: you have to put a bunch of stuff on the front of the phone&mdash;camera, speaker, microphone, proximity sensor, etc.&mdash;so it's currently impossible to make a phone that is all screen. That hasn't stopped several manufacturers from trying. They've taken a number of different approaches to fitting all that stuff on the front of the phone while maximizing the area covered by the screen.

### The "Small Bezel"

LG kicked things off in 2017 with the LG G6 in February. It's a good-looking phone with slimmer top and bottom bezels than most phones, but those bezels still have plenty of room to house all the necessities. The design is more iterative than innovative; the G6 doesn't look strikingly different from most modern smartphones.

Samsung was next with the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. The phones followed the same approach as the G6: shrink the bezels down as small as you can, while keeping a rectangular screen. The Samsung phones have a sleeker, more futuristic design than the G6, and they improve the screen-to-body ratio from about 79% to about 84%. But the idea is still fundamentally the same: keep the basic capactive touchscreen smartphone design, just make the bezels really small.

### The Notch

The first phone&mdash;other than the Mi Mix&mdash;to really depart from the bezel design was the Essential PH-1, which shipped in August. Essential is a new company, founded by Android co-founder Andy Rubin. The Essential PH-1 was the company's first device, and its design raised eyebrows throughout the Android universe. Like the Mi Mix, the PH-1's screen melds beautifully into the top of the frame. Unlike Xaomi, Essential didn't move the front-facing camera to the bottom. Instead, Essential pioneered the "notch" approach to bezel-less smartphone design: let the camera intrude into the screen, and curve the screen around the camera. The PH-1 also has a chin at the bottom where other front-facing necessities reside.

Apple joined the party when it announced the iPhone X in September, to ship in November.

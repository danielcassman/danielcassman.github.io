2017 is the year of the bezel-less smartphone. Ever since the [LG Prada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Prada) was released in May 2007, capacitive touchscreens have become the dominant smartphone interface. Apple popularized them with the [original iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation) (November 2007), and now they're ubiquitous. But the touchscreen has typically been borderd by unsightly bezels. That started to change this year.

Well, it really started last year. Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi launched the [Mi Mix](http://www.mi.com/en/mix/) in November 2016. It was hard to get in the United States, but pretty much everyone thought it was beautiful, and a stunning innovation in the stale slab-like smartphone design that's been essentially unchanged since 2007.

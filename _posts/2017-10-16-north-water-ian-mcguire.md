Ian McGuire's novel _The North Water_ is a story about whaling. That alone invites comparisons to _Moby Dick_, and, indeed, both are gritty, realistic stories about adventures on nineteenth century whalers. But the stories are very different. _The North Water_ is told in the third person and the present tense (which, combined with the graphic descriptions of violence and gore, has prompted comparisons to Cormac McCarthy).

Our protagonist is the Irish doctor Patrick Sumner, who served as an army surgeon during the [Indian Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857) in 1857. Brought low by his own greed and others' dishonesty, Sumner returns to England in disgrace. The only job he can find is the dangerous, poorly remunerated post as ship's surgeon aboard the _Volunteer_. While Sumner is decent at heart, most of the men aboard the _Volunteer_ are not; the captain and first mate are conspiring with the voyage's financier to commit insurance fraud, and one of the harpooners, Henry Drax, is a manifestation of pure evil. Only Otto, a philosophical and spiritual harpooner, provides any sort of moral guidance among the crew. But Otto seems resigned to his fate and has no faith in the power of his actions to change anything.

The book is a vivid account of whaling's latter days. It's also something of a comment on morality, though the battle between good and evil takes place in the background as a group of desperate men struggle to survive. The book is mostly well-written, and I found myself drawn into the plot, if not the characters. _The North Water_ is worth the read if this description sounds interesting to you, but be prepared for the unflinching descriptions of violence and depravity.

Today, Google launched a [major refresh](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/time-refresh-introducing-new-look-and-features-google-calendar-web/) to the design of Google Calendar for the web. The update is long overdue, but it's extremely well-executed and looks stunning. Sometimes you just look at a design and it feels right. This is one of those. After using the new design for a while, I'd imagine it'll be tough to go back to the old one.

<div class="image centered">

  <p class="caption">The new Google Calendar design</p>
</div>

The design uses space beautifully and implements the bold colors, layering, and subtle animations of the [material design standard](https://material.io/). I don't have much else to say, other than that it looks fantastic and I'm thrilled to be using it. If you don't see a button in the top right corner of your Google Calendar offering the option to "Use new Calendar", you can try clicking [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?new_calendar_optin=true).

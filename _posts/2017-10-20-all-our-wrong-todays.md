I loved this book. It's a really fun, fast-paced novel about a guy in a seemingly utopian future with an uhappy family who accidentally destroys the future utopia by using his father's time machine to derail the technological developments that made it possible. But in the much-less-utopian present, our present, he finds that he's a lot happier, his family's a lot happier, and he has a shot at a life with the woman he loves.

The book has good pacing, and the writing is good. I was invested in the characters, and I was dying to know what happen next. I couldn't put it down. That said, the main character's constant self-deprecation gets a little old, and, while Mastai doesn't really delve into the science behind the science fiction, it sometimes feels too convenient and contrived. But that wasn't nearly enough to get in the way of my enjoyment. Bottom line: highly recommended.

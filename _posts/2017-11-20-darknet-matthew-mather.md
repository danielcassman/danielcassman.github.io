Like [Douglas E. Richards's _Infinity Born_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-15-infinity-born-douglas-e-richards %}), _Darknet_ is a near-future science fiction thriller about the dangers of artificial intelligence. But _Darknet_ is a much subtler, carefully crafted, realistic, and enjoyable novel.

_Darknet_ follows several major characters through settings as diverse as Manhattan, Hong Kong, and rural Canada as they struggle against an artificial intelligence created by a hedge fund that's gone rogue and is attempting to take over the world's financial and political systems. The science fiction concepts are interesting and well-executed; the action is usually compelling; and the characters, while still thin, are better developed than those in _Infinity Born_.

That said, there's a noticeable lack of follow-through on Mather's part. For example, one of the most fascinating ideas in the book is the notion of a decentralized autonomous corporation, a corporate entity created and run entirely by an artificial intelligence. A character briefly mentions that such an organization, if incorporated in America, would have certain rights as a "person." That's a really important insight, but one that Mather drops immediately and never revisits. There would be a lot of legal complications involved, but it was an idea that I thought was worth a lot more explanation.

The ending, too, is abrupt and unsatisfying. It feels as though Mather simply ran out of ideas, as though he simply couldn't think of a new way to challenge the protagonists or how to bring the complex world he created to a suitable conclusion.

Despite these problems, I liked the book. If you're interested in reading a novel about AI that provides an intriguing treatment of the subject, this is the one I'd recommend.

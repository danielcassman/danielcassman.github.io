<h2>Hello</h2>

<p>I'm a national security attorney based in San Francisco. I enjoy reading and writing about technology, law, and policy. I've written articles on topics like <a href="http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/print/article/keep-it-secret-keep-it-safe">the state secrets privilege</a> and <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/nuclear-challenge-pakistan-and-iran-part1">nuclear security in Pakistan</a>. I love reading novels and <a href="http://danielcassman.com/expeditions">going on adventures</a>.</p>

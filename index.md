## Hello

I'm a national security attorney based in Washington, D.C. I enjoy reading and writing about technology, law, and policy. I've written articles on topics like [the state secrets privilege](http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/print/article/keep-it-secret-keep-it-safe) and [nuclear security in Pakistan](http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/nuclear-challenge-pakistan-and-iran-part1.). I love reading novels&mdash;including a lot of epic fantasy&mdash;and [going on adventures](http://danielcassman.com/expeditions).
